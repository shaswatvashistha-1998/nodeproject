# nodeproject
This is a node project that helps in the user blogs for authentication.i have not used passport though i have used jwt decoder Buffer which gives out payload so that user data is accesible.

Here Are some of the few methods to use the file.
1.use npm install to install the dependencies.
2.use npm start to run.
3.use postman to call the api's or you can use axios based on your choice.
Ps-You need to use .env for virtual environment files to enable the databse on your computer
